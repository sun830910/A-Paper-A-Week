# Ball*-tree: Efficient spatial indexing for constrained nearest-neighbor search in metric spaces

## Introduction

Various space-partitioning data structures are mainly different in three aspects:

1. The geometric shape of the partition
2. The space-partitioning strategy that builds up the search tree
3. The search algorithm which exploits the data structure to search for the given query.
