# ERNIE - Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration

## Abstract

与BERT的mask策略相比，ERNIE被设计来学习knowledge mask策略，其中包含了entity-level的mask和phrase-level的mask。

Entity-level strategy：mask entities which are usually composed of multiple words.

Phrase-level strategy：mask whole phrase which is composed of several words standing together as comceptual unit.
